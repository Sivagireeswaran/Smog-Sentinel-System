## DATASET
Dataset can be downloaded from this drive link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YmMgkS4rsBGCEpPnYkgfVw3N0DCiNvPQ/view?usp=drive_link
## Description
This project calculates air quality index (AQI) using various pollutant levels like SO2, NO2, RSPM, and SPM. It also includes multiple models (KNN, RandomForest, LogisticRegression, DecisionTree) to classify AQI.

## Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `scripts/`: Contains all the processing, modeling, and evaluation scripts.
- `main.py`: Entry point to run the analysis.

## Requirements
Install the dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
